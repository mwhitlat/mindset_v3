# Mindset – Phase 2 Build Envelope

Version: 1.0
Applies To: Weeks 5-6
Objective: Add governance-lite safeguards around the Phase 1 reflection MVP without expanding into exposure or automation systems.

---

# 1. Purpose of Phase 2

Phase 2 exists to:

* Add a minimal governance control layer.
* Log governance proposals in a structured local format.
* Add manual review gating for proposal application.
* Add rollback to last stable approved configuration.
* Track trust proxies v1 for small trusted-user validation.

This phase does NOT introduce autonomous governance decisions.

---

# 2. Scope (What Must Be Built)

## A. Governance Lite Checks (Hard-Coded)

Implement deterministic structural checks for reflection output and configuration safety:

* Reflection invariant phrase checks (non-prescriptive guardrails).
* Prohibited feature checks (no advisory/scoring/exposure logic paths).
* Permission scope checks (reject manifest permission expansion without operator review).

Checks must be simple and explicit. No semantic classification layer.

## B. Proposal Logging (Local JSON)

When a change proposal is generated by governance checks:

* Write proposal records locally in structured JSON.
* Include:
  * proposal id
  * timestamp
  * proposed change summary
  * triggering check(s)
  * status (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `rolled_back`)
* Keep logs local by default.

No remote sync required in Phase 2.

## C. Manual Review Toggle

Add a manual review mode with explicit operator control:

* `review_required` toggle in local config.
* If enabled, proposals remain pending until manually approved.
* No silent auto-apply of pending proposals.

## D. Rollback Button (Single-Step)

Implement a rollback mechanism to last approved stable snapshot:

* Snapshot approved configuration state.
* On rollback, restore last approved snapshot.
* Log rollback event in proposal log.

Single-step rollback only. No multi-branch history manager.

## E. Trust Proxies v1 (Local)

Track minimal trust signals for trusted internal testing:

* explicit negative feedback event count
* section disablement count
* report reopen count
* uninstall proxy placeholder flag (manual entry allowed)

Store locally and expose in diagnostics view.

No predictive modeling or automated intervention in Phase 2.

---

# 3. Explicit Non-Goals (Must NOT Be Built)

The following are prohibited in Phase 2:

* No exposure engine.
* No perspective clustering.
* No replay simulation engine.
* No semantic diff automation.
* No auto-governance application loops.
* No experiment scheduler.
* No gamification or scoring.
* No third-party analytics integration.
* No hidden telemetry.

If uncertain whether a feature belongs in scope, default to exclusion.

---

# 4. Constraints

## Identity Constraints

All user-facing output must remain:

* observational
* descriptive
* neutral
* non-prescriptive

No advisory framing may be introduced by governance surfaces.

## Privacy Constraints

* Browsing data remains local.
* No raw URLs transmitted externally.
* Proposal and trust-proxy logs are local by default.

## Design Constraints

* Follow Design System v1.
* Reuse existing UI patterns from Phase 1.
* No new visual system layers without explicit approval.

## Architecture Constraints

* Build on Phase 1 baseline.
* Keep modules minimal and explicit.
* Avoid abstraction for future autonomous phases.

# 5. Definition of Done (Phase 2)

Phase 2 is complete when:

1. Governance-lite hard-coded checks run deterministically.
2. Proposal logging writes valid local JSON entries.
3. Manual review toggle blocks auto-application when enabled.
4. Rollback restores the last approved stable snapshot.
5. Trust proxies v1 are collected and visible locally.
6. Reflection output remains neutral and non-prescriptive.
7. Performance remains lightweight with no polling loops.

No additional features required.

---

# 6. Success Criteria

Internal trusted-user validation only (3-5 users).

Success is defined as:

* Governance controls are understandable and predictable.
* Rollback works reliably when invoked.
* Trust proxies are visible and useful for operator review.
* No privacy boundary regression.
* No identity drift toward advisory behavior.

---

# 7. Stop Condition

Stop Phase 2 when:

* Governance-lite checks are stable.
* Review toggle and rollback work end-to-end.
* Trust proxies v1 are recorded and visible.
* No additional governance automation is required for this phase.

Do not proceed to exposure/replay features inside this envelope.

---

# 8. Handoff Rule for Agents

Agents must:

* Build only within this envelope.
* Keep governance logic deterministic and inspectable.
* Avoid adding future-phase infrastructure.
* Escalate irreversible architectural decisions to operator.

If improvement ideas exceed scope, document separately and do not implement.

---

# 9. Escalation Protocol

Escalate only when:

1. Governance constraints conflict with identity/privacy invariants.
2. Permission expansion is required.
3. Rollback design requires irreversible data model changes.

Escalation response must include:

* concise issue summary
* 2 concrete options
* recommended option

---

# 10. Phase Transition Rule

Phase 2 transitions to Phase 3 only when:

* Governance-lite behavior is stable in trusted-user testing.
* Rollback confidence is high.
* Trust proxies are being recorded consistently.
* No hidden complexity is introduced.

No exposure engine implementation before this transition.
