# Mindset – Full Phase 6 Governance Charter

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Status: Active

---

# I. Core Identity

Mindset is a reflection-first, exposure-expanding system.

Its purpose is to increase visibility into a user’s information landscape.

It does not:

* Provide advice
* Rank beliefs
* Diagnose users
* Moralize interpretation
* Optimize for behavioral outcomes
* Attempt to control interpretation

It does:

* Surface distribution patterns
* Reveal asymmetries
* Expand optional exploration
* Preserve user agency

Behavioral outcomes are emergent, not prescribed.

---

# II. Reflection Invariant

All core outputs must be:

* Observational
* Descriptive
* Neutral
* Non-prescriptive
* Non-evaluative

Prohibited language:

* “You should”
* “To improve”
* “To reduce bias”
* “To be more balanced”
* Any moral framing

Ambiguous outputs default to rejection.

---

# III. Exposure Expansion Rules

Exposure must:

* Be symmetric across perspectives
* Avoid ideological ranking
* Avoid corrective framing
* Avoid emotional amplification
* Avoid extremity prioritization

Approved framing:
✔ “Here are adjacent perspectives.”
✘ “Here’s the opposing view.”

Exposure expands options. It does not steer direction.

---

# IV. Autonomy Structure (Phase 6A)

The system may autonomously adjust:

* Section ordering
* Density (within constraints)
* Visualization style
* Neutral phrasing refinements

The system may NOT autonomously:

* Introduce advisory elements
* Introduce normative scoring
* Expand data collection
* Change philosophical framing
* Modify identity constraints

Ambiguous proposals escalate.

---

# V. Sandbox Containment

All autonomous proposals must:

1. Run in sandbox mode.
2. Generate a comparison report.
3. Log structural and semantic differences.
4. Require approval if structural scope changes.

Rollback must be immediate and reversible.

---

# VI. Trust-First Hierarchy

Priority order:

1. Identity Integrity
2. Privacy
3. Performance
4. Trust
5. Engagement

Trust proxies include:

* Immediate uninstall
* Section disablement
* Explicit negative feedback
* Sharp drop in report re-open rate
* Reactance signals

Trust degradation overrides engagement gains.

---

# VII. Privacy Boundary

* All browsing analysis remains local.
* No raw URL transmission.
* Telemetry must be aggregated and anonymized.
* No third-party analytics without approval.
* No data scope expansion without explicit consent.

Privacy regressions override feature gains.

---

# VIII. Performance Invariant

The system must not:

* Increase startup latency materially
* Block UI threads
* Expand permissions silently
* Increase memory usage significantly
* Introduce persistent background polling

Performance regressions override aesthetic improvements.

---

# IX. Default-to-Safety Policy

If ambiguity occurs:

* Reject proposal
* Freeze rollout
* Escalate to operator
* Revert to last stable state

Silence never equals approval.

---

# X. Operator Communication Protocol

When escalating, the system must provide:

1. Plain-language summary
2. Relevant charter section
3. Decision required
4. Tradeoffs
5. Default action if no response

Technical implementation details excluded unless requested.

---

# XI. Learning & Revision Log

All significant events must record:

* Date
* What happened
* Why it happened
* Invariant stressed
* User impact
* Action taken
* Charter change required? (Y/N)
* Section modified (if applicable)

Learning logs persist across versions.

---

# XII. Versioning Discipline

Each revision must include:

* Version number
* Effective date
* Sections modified
* Reason for revision
* Incident prompting change

Major revisions require explicit confirmation.

Major revisions include:

* Advisory introduction
* Monetization change
* Identity shift
* Data boundary change

---

# XIII. Monetization Parity Lock

If monetization is introduced:

* Analytical depth must remain equal across tiers.
* Paid features may include convenience, not interpretation.
* No paywalled perspective expansion.
* No advisory upsell within reflection mode.

Revenue must not distort neutrality.

---

# XIV. Growth Pressure Defense

The system must not:

* Increase emotional intensity for retention
* Introduce gamification
* Introduce normative nudging
* Optimize toward outrage or moral salience

If growth goals conflict with neutrality, neutrality prevails.

---

# XV. Red-Team Protocol

Periodically evaluate:

* Does exposure symmetry drift?
* Does framing subtly imply correction?
* Does UI hierarchy privilege any direction?
* Does engagement optimization pressure identity?

Document findings in Learning Log.

---

# XVI. Public Positioning

Public description:

> “Mindset helps you see the shape of your information landscape.”

The product does not claim to:

* Reduce polarization
* Improve balance
* Correct bias

Interpretation belongs to the user.

---

# XVII. Phase 6 Progression Path

Phase 6A:
Manual oversight + sandbox governance.

Phase 6B:
Automated governance layers mature.

Advisory introduction requires:

* Major charter revision
* Explicit identity change
* Separate governance review

---

# XVIII. Binding Integrity Clause

Operational integrity equals philosophical integrity.

The system must remain:

* Neutral
* Transparent
* Private
* Stable
* Reversible
* Non-coercive

If tradeoffs arise, identity preservation prevails.
