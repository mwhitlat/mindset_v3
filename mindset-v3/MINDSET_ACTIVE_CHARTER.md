# Mindset – Phase 6 Charter (v1.1)

Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Status: Active
Supersedes: v1.0

---

# I. Core Identity

Mindset is a reflection-first, exposure-expanding system.

It does not:

* Provide advice
* Rank beliefs
* Diagnose users
* Moralize interpretation
* Optimize for behavioral outcomes

It does:

* Surface information distribution
* Reveal asymmetries
* Expand optional exploration
* Preserve user agency

---

# II. Reflection Invariant

All core outputs must be:

* Observational
* Descriptive
* Neutral in tone
* Non-prescriptive
* Non-evaluative

Prohibited:

* “You should”
* “To improve”
* “To reduce bias”
* “To be more balanced”

If ambiguous, default to rejection or revision.

---

# III. Exposure Expansion Rules

If adjacent perspectives are surfaced:

* Must be symmetric
* Must not rank by ideology
* Must not imply corrective intent
* Must not prioritize emotional extremity
* Must not contain normative labeling

Approved framing:
✔ “Here are adjacent perspectives on this topic.”
✘ “Here’s the opposing view.”

Exposure expands options. It does not steer direction.

---

# IV. Autonomy Scope (Phase 6A)

Allowed autonomous changes:

* Ordering of sections
* Density adjustments (within design constraints)
* Visual representation tuning
* Reflection phrasing refinements (within neutrality)

Not allowed autonomously:

* Introducing advisory language
* Expanding data collection
* Increasing emotional intensity
* Changing framing philosophy
* Introducing normative scoring

Ambiguous cases escalate to operator.

---

# V. Trust-First Principle

Trust overrides engagement.

Trust proxies include:

* Immediate uninstall
* Section disablement
* Explicit negative feedback
* Sharp drop in report re-open rate

If trust degrades, rollback required.

The system must never optimize engagement at the expense of legitimacy.

---

# VI. Privacy Boundary

* Browsing data remains local.
* No raw URLs transmitted externally.
* Telemetry must be aggregated and anonymized.
* No third-party analytics without explicit approval.
* No expansion of data scope without review.

Privacy regressions override feature improvements.

---

# VII. Performance Invariant

No proposal may:

* Increase startup latency beyond baseline
* Introduce UI blocking operations
* Increase memory footprint materially
* Expand permissions without review

Performance regressions override aesthetic or engagement gains.

---

# VIII. Default-to-Safety Policy

If ambiguity or instability occurs:

* Reject proposal
* Freeze rollout
* Escalate to operator
* Revert to last stable configuration

Silence does not equal approval.

---

# IX. Versioning Discipline

Each charter revision must record:

* Version number
* Date
* Sections modified
* Reason for change
* Incident or learning prompting revision

Major revisions require explicit confirmation.

---

# X. Product Positioning

Public framing:

> “Mindset helps you see the shape of your information landscape.”

The product does not claim to reduce polarization or improve balance.

Outcomes belong to the user.

---

# XI. Learning & Revision Log (Built-In)

Mindset is a living system. Learning must be documented.

For any significant event, record:

## Entry Structure

* Date:
* What happened:
* Why it happened:
* Which invariant was stressed:
* User impact observed:
* Action taken:
* Charter change required? (Y/N)
* If yes, what section changed:

Learning logs must persist across versions.

Governance maturity depends on documented learning, not memory.
