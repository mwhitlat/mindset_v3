# 90-Day Build Roadmap

Goal: Balanced, slightly conservative Phase-6A launch.

---

## Weeks 1–2

* Extension skeleton
* IndexedDB storage
* Basic URL capture
* Performance logging
* Identity hard-coded

Deliverable: Silent local capture.

---

## Weeks 3–4

* Reflection prompt v1
* Weekly report generation
* Design system implementation
* End-to-end report UI

Deliverable: Working reflection MVP.

Expose to: No external users yet.

---

## Weeks 5–6

* Governance lite
* Proposal logging
* Manual review toggle
* Rollback button
* Trust proxies v1

Expose to: 3–5 trusted users.

---

## Weeks 7–8

* Replay lite
* Exposure engine v1
* Sandbox mode
* Density tests

Expose to: 10–15 users.

---

## Weeks 9–12

* Calibrate invariants
* Monitor trust signals
* Tighten symmetry logic
* Stabilize UI density

Ready for broader pilot.

---

## Ship Definition

Ship when:

* Reflection feels neutral and coherent
* Exposure expansion is symmetric
* Rollback works
* Privacy boundaries intact
* Trust stable

Not when automation is perfect.
