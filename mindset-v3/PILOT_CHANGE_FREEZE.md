# Pilot Change Freeze

Effective date: 2026-02-25
Phase: Maturity Phase 7

## Frozen Categories

- New feature categories (governance automation, recommendation engines, growth/optimization systems)
- New telemetry/analytics or external data flows
- Major UI redesign and non-defect-driven refactors
- Permission model expansion

## Allowed Changes During Freeze

- Confirmed defect fixes
- Reliability hardening for existing flows
- Error-message clarity improvements that unblock operator workflows
- Validation artifact updates and test maintenance tied to known defects

## Exception Path

If a frozen-category change is requested:

1. Open an escalation using `ESCALATION_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Document risk, two options, recommended path, and reversibility.
3. Proceed only after explicit operator approval.

## Current Freeze Assessment

- Critical/high pilot blockers: none currently open.
- Change policy status: active.
