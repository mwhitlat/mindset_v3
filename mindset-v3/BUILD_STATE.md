# BUILD STATE

- Current Phase: Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4) - Reflection-only MVP
- Completed Tasks:
  - Created Manifest v3 extension skeleton (`manifest.json`)
  - Implemented local metadata capture via content script (`content.js`)
  - Implemented IndexedDB local storage and weekly aggregation (`background.js`)
  - Implemented deterministic local reflection generation (`background.js`)
  - Implemented single-view weekly report UI aligned to Design System v1 (`popup.html`, `popup.css`, `popup.js`)
  - Added basic performance debug logging without polling (`background.js`)
  - Added automated Phase 1 smoke test (`scripts/phase1-smoke-v3.mjs`, `package.json`)
  - Added repeatable Phase 1 validation runbook (`PHASE1_VALIDATION.md`)
  - Added in-report summary section for totals and date window (`popup.html`, `popup.css`, `popup.js`)
  - Added local performance diagnostics capture and popup visibility (`background.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`)
  - Removed all LLM integration and settings UI to keep reflection fully local and Phase 1 minimal (`background.js`, `manifest.json`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`)
  - Added explicit popup note that reflection is generated locally from weekly aggregates (`popup.html`)
- Next Atomic Task:
  - Execute manual Chrome validation pass on the local-only baseline before push checkpoint.
- Known Issues:
  - `MINDSET_ACTIVE_CHARTER.md` currently describes Phase 6, so Phase 1 scope is anchored primarily by Build Envelope + Roadmap in this workspace.
