- Next Atomic Task:
  - Start Maturity Phase 8 Task 1: create final pilot readiness checklist and release candidate record artifacts.
- Known Issues:
  - `MINDSET_ACTIVE_CHARTER.md` currently describes Phase 6, so Phase 1 scope is anchored primarily by Build Envelope + Roadmap in this workspace.
  - Build Envelope references deterministic LLM prompting, but implementation is intentionally local-only per operator direction.
